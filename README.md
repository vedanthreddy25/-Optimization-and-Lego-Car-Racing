**Lego Car Racing Project**

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the Lego Car Racing Project! This repository houses the culmination of our efforts in designing competitive Lego cars using innovative approaches blending creativity, experimentation, and mathematical modeling.

**Project Overview:**
The project is divided into two distinct phases:

1. **Phase I - Understanding Performance Factors:**
   - Identified key factors impacting Lego car performance, including aerodynamics, weight, wheel size, and surface area.
   - Conducted thorough experimentation and research to assign numerical values to each Lego part based on its contribution to performance.

2. **Phase II - Mathematical Optimization:**
   - Developed a mathematical model to optimize car design within specified budget constraints.
   - Defined decision variables, parameters, and constraints to formulate an objective function aiming to maximize total distance traveled by the car.

**Implementation:**
- **Code**: Our Cplex code implementation transforms decision variables, parameters, constraints, and the objective function into actionable insights for car design.
- **Challenges**: We encountered and overcame obstacles such as factor identification, part valuation, and code transformation through collaborative problem-solving and resource utilization.
